    <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener">在</span>甲殼人王國，今天是美麗的一天，就和在人類王國一樣，也和在蠑螈村一樣。儘管你們創造的這個天堂可能有什麼缺陷，但你從沒聽過任何有關天氣的抱怨。你正和羅克西與卡利俄佩一起坐在一個棋盤方格紋樣的巨大桌布上。設計質感不錯，你這麼想著，但如果你花上一點時間在甲殼人王國中購物就會發現幾乎所有能買的東西都是棋子主題的。 </p>
    <p>友善的甲殼人們在你身邊過著他們的日常，他們穿過公園時眼睛禮貌的避開你們，假裝沒注意到三位名人正在附近的草坪上吃午餐。他們格外有禮貌，因為你和羅克西正在聊非常私人的事情。</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="john">約翰：她看起來還好。就只是太累了。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：至少她看起來還有足夠的力氣丟出滔滔不絕的哲學的什麼東西，和有關原著的事情。</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：笑死</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：所以她給你灌了一堆的終極人格的垃圾囉</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：什麼人格？</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：就她開始擁有一切知識然後很不舒服的事情</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：喔。她沒有那個詞。她只是一直形容它，並把它叫做一種症狀。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：你沒有感受到類似事吧？</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：什麼 認識到我們終極人格嗎?</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：嗯。</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：拜託我連我的基礎蠢蛋人格都搞不定了</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：嘿嘿。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：是呀，她說她是唯一一個有這個經歷的，據她所知。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：可憐的羅絲</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：至少那些藥似乎能還幫她維持基本正常運作。</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">羅克西嚴肅的斜眼瞪著你。</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; 想起羅絲的那一大串絕對不是因為誰才開啟的有關她的藥癮的談話。</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="john">約翰：她有說不是那樣子的！</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：就是……她說她是在控制下服用的。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：呃，我能知道什麼呢。我唯一用過的非法藥物是舔了那支<b>蠢暴的</b>惡作劇棒棒糖</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：<b>絕不再碰了</b></p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：唉怎樣都好啦</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：這也不太算是我能管的事情</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：羅絲和我的關係沒以前那麼親近了</p>
    </div>
      <p class="no-indent">有意無意的，你點了點頭，因為你正在思考你和羅絲也有多少年沒說過話了。羅克西用疑惑的眼神看著你，但你在她能從你的表情中汲取出含意前別過了頭。</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：瑪麗彥(Maryam)在她倆婚後讓她忙得不可開交。</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：她們就那樣消失在育雛窟裡也沒有其他消息</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：只有在她生病之後她才會在家裡待比較久 我們那之後才又開始重新聊得比較多</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：這是好事但我們的談話都是一些有點沮喪的事</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">來了，在羅克西傳訊息給你後你就一直想要回避的念頭，你到底也有多久沒和羅克西說話了。你在無視它的這段時間內過得延好的。</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; 改變話題。</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="john">約翰：所以，你和卡利還跟我上次見到的一樣住在一起嗎？就是鐘樓旁邊？</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">你看向遠處的鐘樓，哥德式的建築在正午的太陽下切出了一道陰影。它是王國裡的重要地標，也是周圍幾里內最高的建築，上去那裡唯一的方法是飛行。其他的甲殼人建築長得都一模一樣，反映了他們功能性的集體主義社會。</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：是啊</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：真酷。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：那是個好地方</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：對呀我喜歡這裡</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：我有想過但我大概不會想去住在其他的王國裡</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：被棋子人圍繞著的感覺還是最自在的</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：有道理。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：我被蠑螈圍繞著也是類似的感覺。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：呃……我發現這他媽完全沒道理。</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：哈哈</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：他們過著簡單的生活。</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：我真的不想去人類或troll的城市混沌裡參和。</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：我也是</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">你看見羅克西微笑著伸手摸向卡利俄佩的手。</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; 在你沉浸於這副景像前把目光移開。</p>
    <p class="no-indent">你立即開始沉浸於眼前這副景像，你將視線甩離的速度之快，也許還有點引人注目了。不過認真的，她的之間的關係<em>到底是</em>怎樣子的呢？是浪漫的？還是柏拉圖式的？智天使甚至能有浪漫情感嗎？他們會甚至對這樣的事<em>有興趣</em>嗎？就是，在根本上有嗎？他們的腦和他們的心甚至是那樣運作的嗎？類似的問題從前常讓你夜晚睡不著覺。</p>
    <p>You look at them, at where Roxy’s fingers are entwined with Calliope’s green claws. Calliope is still wearing the Ring of Life. The same one you obtained in a ludicrous adventure through the afterlife, and then re-obtained in a ludicrous adventure through canon when it was stolen from you. It’s the same one that allowed Calliope to stop being dead in the first place, and to come live with your friends here on your beautifully renovated home planet. And it’s the same one you gave Roxy all those years ago, to fulfill a promise made to a very special new friend.</p>
    <p>At the time, the gesture felt so important. It felt more meaningful than any gift you’d ever given. Like there was some grand emotional gravitas about it that signified something deeper than... than what it turned out to be. </p>
    <p>You have since concluded you were just imagining things. Ascribing symbolic meaning to gestures that they simply didn’t carry, like the dumb kid you were.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Tactfully avoid saying anything at all about Roxy and Calliope’s weird, ambiguous relationship.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="john">約翰：uh, so...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">But you can’t stop thinking about it. What goes on in Roxy’s head. What she thinks about you. </p>
    <p>You and all your friends have dispositions affected by your classes and aspects. You think you know what that means in your case. But what about her? You can only speculate. Void is a place where things sink and disappear. Where they linger forever, but cease to exist. You aren’t actually sure if your feelings for Roxy ever really faded, or if they just grew numb with time and distance. Is it the same for her?</p>
    <p>You search your soul for the answer, but come up empty. The truth is, you suspect her mental interior is unfathomable. In fact, you feel sure of it. </p>
    <p>You wonder suddenly, watching her. This version of her, that is. The one with whom you share all these bittersweet memories—will you ever see her again?</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：咳咳。</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：約翰！</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：什麼事？</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：please forgive me if i come across as impatient. bUt if we are finished with the pleasantries, i believe yoU have a choice to make.</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：huh?</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：the choice as to whether yoU will go defeat my brother, or stay here.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：have yoU decided yet?</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：there’s a choice??</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope is smiling brightly, but Roxy’s face has no expression at all.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="john">約翰：i was just assuming i had to go.</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：because if i don’t, then...  </p>
      <p class="john">約翰：a lot of stuff will stop being real. or i mean, stop being canon?</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：to tell you the truth, i’m a little confused about what will happen if i don’t go.</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：but it sounds like it will probably be bad!</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：that may be so. </p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：we are not here to caUtion yoU aboUt the conseqUences of yoUr decision either way.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：bUt there is always a choice!</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：roxy and i merely wished to invite yoU here for a nice hUman picnic, and show oUr sUpport for whichever decision yoU make.</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：tbh its a relief to finally be doin this</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：it is?</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：mm hm</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：how much have you actually... talked about this? i mean, how many people knew this was going to be a thing?</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：just us and rose. well dirk too i think</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：shes been talkin to me about it a bunch</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：and him too but i dunno how much</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：hes got like</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：“thoughts” about all this shit</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：but whatever thats not important or even remotely surprising</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：bottom line, rose has been tormenting herself about having to tell you</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：im just glad she finally said it so she can rest</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：now its up to you</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：yes. take all the time yoU need.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：again, we aren’t here to inflUence yoU. it’s very important that the decision come from yoUr desire to go throUgh with it, one way or another.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：any tampering coUld taint the resUlts.</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：taint the...  </p>
      <p class="john">約翰：wait, what?</p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：so whatll it be john</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">A chill runs through you and stays there.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Consider the gravitas of this choice.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You try, but you can’t, because you weren’t really prepared for it. You didn’t think it was a choice at all until this very second. You think back to the way Rose looked at you before she went to bed. What has she told Roxy that she didn’t tell you? The chill tightens around your throat and turns into fear. </p>
    <p>No, not fear. The feeling is worse than that. It’s <em>regret</em>. </p>
    <p>You wasted your time here on this idyllic restoration of Earth. Why did you spend so much time alone? Moping around the house mourning your dead father, who probably would have wanted you to get more enjoyment out of your teen years, as well as your unusually early retirement. There’s so much you could have done. You could have even reached out to Roxy again; maybe she was waiting for you to do that. Maybe your withdrawal hurt her. Maybe she was heartbroken, just like you kind of feel right now. You study her perfectly stoic face and conclude nothing from it. Her expression reminds you of how Dave used to look, when you first met for real, before years of living with Karkat softened him up. Impenetrable cool. </p>
    <p>It’s too late to figure any of this out now. You fucked it up already.</p>
    <p>Unless, of course, you choose to stay.</p>
    <p>Upon further examination, you realize that Roxy’s stoicism isn’t cold. There’s concern there. She is displaying restraint, keeping quiet while you make up your mind. You’re sweating, you realize. Cold sweat. Even worse than the anime nightmare sweat you woke up soaked in this morning.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：john u ok?</p>
      <p class="john">約翰：... </p>
      <p class="roxy">羅克西：looked like you were gonna pass out there for a second</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Suddenly, Calliope bolts upright.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：of coUrse! what was i thinking.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：this decision is far too important to be made on an empty stomach.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She fetches the picnic basket, which naturally has been sitting there on the tablecloth since the moment you arrived.</p>
    <div class="chat">
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：here, before yoU choose which path yoU’re going to take, yoU shoUld decide what yoU’d like to eat!</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：i have packed a wide variety of provisions. easily enoUgh to satisfy even the most ravenoUs picnic-goer’s appetite.</p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：behold, an array of savory delights for the carnally inclined. </p>
      <p class="calliope">卡利俄佩：or perhaps something for yoUr sweet tooth, if a lUst for treats is what stokes yoUr desire?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope produces two dishes from the basket and begins gingerly unwrapping them. The unwrapping is so ginger, in fact, that there’s something almost dramatic about it. Like the opening theme to that boring sci-fi movie with the monolith and the bone-throwing monkeys should be playing as she peels away the cheesecloth. </p>
    <p>On one plate is a pile of meat: rare, almost bleeding cuts from animals you can’t identify. The other plate holds a generous heap of colorful, exotic-looking candy. You scoot to the side and peek into the basket to see if there’s anything else. There’s a book in there, but no more food. This is all there is.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Contemplate your lunch.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You put a finger to your lips and focus on the food with great intensity. You stop fretting about choices, and heartbreak, and eternity, and Lord English. Your entire world narrows to a single point of light as you are utterly consumed by the overbearing decision about which of these absurd meals to have for lunch.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; MEAT or CANDY?</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Meat or candy. The two possibilities pinball around your skull. Meat or candy. It’s a tough choice. On any other day you might be inclined to simply follow the whims of your cravings, but no clear victor surges to the forefront of your mind.</p>
    <p>Either option offers a tempting means of sustenance. You know the meat will be rich and filling, and if you’re being honest with yourself, you haven’t had the most robust diet as of late. You didn’t even have breakfast. It’s probably a good idea to eat something resembling a real meal for once.</p>
    <p>But you’re no stranger to Calliope’s tastes, as far as carnivorous comestibles are concerned. You know every cut on that plate is rare to the core. It’ll fill your mouth to bursting with juice, lie heavy on your stomach for hours to come as your body works to break down all the nutritious protein and fat.</p>
    <p>It might be tough to chew. It might be even tougher to swallow.</p>
    <p>Maybe the candy is the better choice for a picnic like this. Something that’ll go down easy and fill you with bright energy as you pass the time with your friends. You know you need to just let go sometimes, and stop worrying so much about what other people expect of you. Or even what <em>you</em> expect of you. It’s not a bad thing to enjoy yourself just for the sake of pleasure.</p>
    <p>But eat too much and all that sweetness could make you sick.</p>
    <p>Roxy and Calliope glance at each other in confusion as you deliberate over what to eat. You suppose it’s taking you a while to choose, but each dish is appealing enough in certain ways. Each has its potential dietary drawbacks. You don’t want to make a decision you can’t stomach.</p>
    <p>Meat or candy, John. Meat or candy?</p>
    <p>You release your breath when you realize you’ve been holding it. You’re being ridiculous. What’s the sense of fussing over lunch? In the end, it really doesn’t matter. Whatever you choose, it’ll all be flushed down the toilet tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Just go with your gut. Don’t sweat the small stuff. There are much more important things out there to fuck yourself up over.</p>
